#### Assembly of the circuit

The Fritzing scheme is as follows:

- Density bar

![Circuit that manages the density bar](images/medicion_densidad/barra_densidad_bb.png "Circuit that manages the density bar")

This circuit is responsible for obtaining the measurements and send notifications to the communications bar for redirection.

- Communication bar

![Circuit that manages the communication bar](images/medicion_densidad/barra_densidad_conector_bb.png "Circuit that manages the communication bar")

This circuit is responsible for the communications of the density bar, in addition to the power supply of the bar and all the components it contains.

- Arduino with screen

![Arduino with screen](images/medicion_densidad/ard_pantalla_bb.png "Arduino with screen")

This assembly is the one made to replace the burned Industruino.

#### Software: Functionality to be implemented and protocol design used

This section discusses the functionality of the software created and the messaging protocol that has been designed so that the communication meets the desired functionality.

The functionality of the implemented software is as follows:

* Auto calibration of light sensors. This step must be performed automatically when the density bar is started or when the user asks for it.
* From an average value of light that is considered as valid (the quality of the product is correct) you must indicate a higher percentage and a lower percentage, within which the product is considered to contain the desired quality. The valid value is obtained from the auto calibration.
* From the data of the 2 previous points send a signal if the product is not within the desired quality.

Each of the bars is responsible for one or several features and the Industruino (and later the Arduino with screen) of others, these are:

* Industruino / Arduino  with screen:
 - Configuration of the percentages to apply to the average value of quality.
 - Activate the warning signal if you receive notification that a piece has been found that does not meet the quality.
 - Density bar configuration request.
* Density bar
 - Auto calibration execution, either at startup or when prompted.
 - Perform measurements and advise if any is out of range.
* Communication bar
 - Intermediate between the density bar and the Industruino, within this role is responsible for:
   - Convert the percentages passed by the Industruino to values within the measuring range and communicate them to the density bar.
   - Ask the density bar the values required by the Industruino and transform them if necessary.
   - Filtering the ads from the density bar to the Industruino only alerts the Industruino if there has been a change.

For communication between the bars, the following messaging protocol was designed:

* Requests from the Industruino
 1. Request current bar configuration.
 
![esquema_01_01](images/medicion_densidad/esquema_01_01.en.png)

 2. Configuration data for the bar (data modified in Industruino and sent to the bars).
 
![esquema_01_02](images/medicion_densidad/esquema_01_02.en.png)

 3. Auto calibration request bar.
 
![esquema_01_03](images/medicion_densidad/esquema_01_03.en.png)

* Shipments to the Industruino, independent of the previous ones in response to a request of this one

 1. Sending information auto calibrated (the first start of the bar always performs a self calibration without being prompted by the Industruino)
 
![esquema_02_01](images/medicion_densidad/esquema_02_01.en.png)

 2. Sending data about the readings. It is only sent when there is a change between in or out of range.
